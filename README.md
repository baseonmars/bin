# Base on Mars shell scripts

This is my handy dandy collection of shell scripts. Some of them might be more useful than others.

I'm relatively new to shell automation so the quality of scripts are sometimes questionable, I'll
continue to improve them as time goes by.

Some of these scripts may be so badly written they cause damage. Please take the time to read
through each script and understand the consequences of the commands it executes.
